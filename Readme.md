##Information
A simple program to model the death rate of the black death in a pre-defined area. Two files detail the average population density and the number of rats killed per 100m2 respectively; these are then combined in an equation to give the predicted death rate per week. The factors in this equation can be adjusted using slide bars.

##Technologies
Python 3.6

##Sources
This program was created as the second assessment for the GEOG5003 module at the University of Leeds, _Programming for Geographical Information Analysis_, as part of the GIS MSc Online Distance Learning course.
